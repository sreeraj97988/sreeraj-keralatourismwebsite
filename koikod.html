     <p>Kozhikode ([koːɻikoːɖ] (About this soundlisten)), also known as Calicut, is an Indian city, second-largest urban agglomeration in the State of Kerala and 19th largest in the country with a population of 2.4 million according to 2011 census.[8] Calicut is a Tier 2 metropolitant city according to government of India classification.[9]

        During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point of Indian spices.[1] A historical city, it was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages. According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode ranked as the second best city in India to reside in. Also known as Calicut. During the British rule, Madras was the capital of the Malabar district which was part of the state. In ancient times it was known as the richest city in the world. Foreigners such as Arabs, Turks, Egyptians and Chinese traded here. The Zamorin ruled Kozhikode for a long time. Kozhikode district came into existence on January 1, 1957. The district covers an area of 28,79,131 km2 and consists of four taluks namely Vadakara, Koyilandy, Thamarassery and Kozhikode.[10]

        Although the city's official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut.[14] The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.[15] It is the historical capital of Kerala as the history dates back to 1498 AD when Vasco da Gama landed in Kappad, near Calicut.[16]

        Kozhikode and its suburbs formed part of the Polanad kingdom ruled by the Porlatiri.[23] The Eradis of Nediyirippu in Eranad wanted an outlet to the sea, to initiate trade and commerce with the distant lands.[24] and after fighting with the king Polatthiri for 48 years conquered the area around Panniankara. After this, Menokki became the ruler of Polanad and came to terms with the troops and people.[25] After this, the town of Kozhikode was founded close to the palace at Tali.[26] Then, the Eradis shifted their headquarters from Nediyirippu to Kozhikode. The Governor of Ernad built a fort at a place called Velapuram to safeguard his new interests. The fort most likely lent its name to Koyil Kotta the precursor to Kozhikode. Thus the city came into existence sometime in the 13th century CE. The status of Udaiyavar increased and he became known as Swami Nambiyathiri Thirumulpad, and eventually Samuri or Samoothiri. Europeans called him in a corrupt form as Zamorin.
